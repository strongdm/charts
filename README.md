## [StrongDM Relay/Gateway](deployments/sdm-relay)

### Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes Cluster v1.16+
* Helm 3.0+
* Git
* If you are going to use [Nginx Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/), then you will need to manually patch your [services to allow TCP and UDP traffic](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/exposing-tcp-udp-services/)
* [A StrongDM Gateway/Relay Token](https://www.strongdm.com/docs/admin-ui-guide/network/gateways)

### Installing the Chart

```shell
helm repo add strongdm https://helm.strongdm.com/stable/
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] strongdm/sdm-relay -f values.yaml
helm status [RELEASE_NAME]
```

_See [configuration](deployments/sdm-relay/README.md#configuration) options._

_See [helm install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) for command documentation._

### Upgrading the Chart

```shell
helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] strongdm/sdm-relay --install
```

_See [helm upgrade](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for command documentation._

### Uninstalling the Chart

```shell
helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME]
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the release and deletes the release.

_See [helm uninstall](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for command documentation._

## [StrongDM Client Container](deployments/sdm-client)

This repo provides an implementation of a StrongDM Client Container inside Kubernetes using Helm.

### Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes Cluster v1.16+

* [A StrongDM Service Token](https://www.strongdm.com/docs/admin-ui-guide/access/service-accounts)
