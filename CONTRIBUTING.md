If you would like to suggest changes, please create an issue in this project. We also accept Pull Requests from forked repositories.

Be sure to update the version in `Chart.yaml` for each chart you're updating. Do your best to adhere to SemVer, the team is happy to discuss which version bump is appropriate if you're unsure.

For all major version bumps, or any change you wish to validate more completely, please create a development version. Validate the changes after your PR has been merged, then raise another PR to cut a non-development version.
